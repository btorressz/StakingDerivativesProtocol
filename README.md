# Solana Staking Derivatives Protocol
(This is an example of a project I have made for a client)
This project implements a staking derivatives protocol on the Solana blockchain. The protocol allows users to tokenize their staked SOL (e.g., liquid staking) by minting derivative tokens. Users can deposit SOL, receive tokenized representations, and earn staking rewards. These tokenized assets can then be freely traded or used as collateral in other DeFi protocols.


## Overview

The Solana Staking Derivatives Protocol is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to:
1. Deposit SOL and receive derivative tokens representing the staked SOL.
2. Withdraw staked SOL by burning the derivative tokens.
3. Compound staking rewards periodically.
4. Perform emergency unstaking with penalties.
5. Distribute rewards using a checkpoint-based reward distribution system.
6. Participate in a governance mechanism by voting on proposals.
7. Create referral links to incentivize new users.

 The program is written in Rust, with a corresponding client written in TypeScript for interacting with the program on Solana Playground.
